# Azure VM Alert Monitoring

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to monitor Azure Virtual Machines and set up automated alerts for critical metrics such as CPU usage, memory utilization, and disk space. Alerts are configured to notify users via email or other channels when thresholds are exceeded.

## Features
- Monitor CPU, memory, and disk metrics.
- Set up threshold-based alerts.
- Configure Action Groups for email notifications.
- Easy to extend for other Azure resources.

## Tools & Technologies
- Azure Portal
- Azure Monitor
- Azure Virtual Machines
- Action Groups (Email notifications)
- Optional: PowerShell / Azure CLI scripts

## Steps Performed
1. Created a virtual machine in Azure.
2. Configured monitoring using Azure Monitor.
3. Created an alert rule based on CPU usage.
4. Set up an Action Group to send email notifications.
5. Tested the alert by simulating high CPU usage.


## Learning Outcomes
- Understanding Azure Monitor metrics and alerting.
- Configuring Action Groups for notifications.
- Practical experience in monitoring cloud infrastructure.
